            <h2 class="titleart">What is a No-Hit Run?</h2>
            <p class="textart">A No-Hit Run in the Soulsborne series is completing a game from start to finish without taking any hits. There are a number of different categories based on how much content in the game has been completed; this includes: Any% (minimum requirement for beating the game), All Vanilla Bosses (main game), and All Bosses (with DLCs). These runs are generally done without the use of quitouts and major skips/glitches (deathcams/out of bounds).</p>

            <h2 class="titleart">What is a Hit?</h2>
            <p class="textart">A Hit is classified as a loss of health or a stagger caused by an enemy or trap. This includes attacks from enemies that deal no damage and also status effects, such as poison, that triggers on the player as a result of an enemy attack.</p>

            <h2 class="titleart">What is a No-Damage Run?</h2>
            <p class="textart">A No-Damage Run is completing a game from start to finish without taking any damage and without saving at any point of the game. There are a number of different categories based on how much content in the game has been completed usually based on the difficulty of the game; this includes for example: Any% (minimum requirement for beating the game), Hardcore (beating the game on the highest difficulty of RE2 REmake), or Real Survivor Mode (beating RE1R on this mode). These runs are done without the use of quitouts and major skips/glitches (deathcams/out of bounds).</p>

    <div class="card">
        <h2 class="titleart">What is Damage?</h2>
        <p class="textart">Damage is classified as a loss of health caused by an enemy, trap (ex. RE4 traps) or grabs. This includes attacks from enemies that deal damage and also status effects, such as poison, that triggers on the player as a result of an enemy attack or trap. Do not get confused with a No Hit Run as it is very different (ex. on a No Damage Run staggers doesn’t matter unless it deals damage).</p>
